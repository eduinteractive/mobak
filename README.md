# MOBAK App

Installation Instructions

1. Install dependencies (only needed the first time or when dependencies change):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This will launch the Expo development server. You can then open the app in an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or on your device using the Expo Go app.
